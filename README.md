# Professional README Generator

## Description

---

Struggling to create a README from scratch? This application is designed to take in your inputs from the command-line to create a simple README file. As a result, you will be able to concentrate more on the project itself rather than the README as a developer.

## Installation

---

    - Download or clone this repository,
    - Make sure to have Node.js installed,
    - Open up your integrated terminal and type "npm install" or "npm i" to install the required npm packages

## Usage

---

Application is inititalized by opening up the integrated terminal and then typing the following command

    node index.js

You will then be guided through a series of prompts. Your responses to these prompts will then be used to create a README file. If you made a mistake during the process, feel free to fix the mistakes in the README file itself or to run the command again, as it would just overwrite the previous generated file.
